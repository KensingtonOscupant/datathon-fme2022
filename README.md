# Accenture Challenge: Supply Chain Resilience

This repository details a case study on supply chain resilience using data from a European fashion retailer. It aims to determine how likely it is for an order not to reach the customer on time. The project was created at [Datathon FME 2022](https://datathon.cat/). Our final model was too large to be deployed on GitHub, which is why we used a more lightweight version of it only containing the XGBoost model in the ensemble for deploying the app to production. **A live version is available [here](tab:https://kensingtonoscupant-datathon-fme2022-srcstreamlit-streaml-p41g62.streamlit.app/).**
